    "**Topics, number of exercises:** This problem builds on your knowledge of mostly Pandas with a little NumPy. It has **9** exercises, numbered 0 to **8**. There are **21** available points. However, to earn 100% the threshold is **13** points. (Therefore, once you hit **13** points, you can stop. There is no extra credit for exceeding this threshold.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise ordering:** Each exercise builds logically on previous exercises, but you may solve them in any order. That is, if you can't solve an exercise, you can still move on and try the next one. Use this to your advantage, as the exercises are **not** necessarily ordered in terms of difficulty. Higher point values generally indicate more difficult exercises. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Demo cells:** Code cells starting with the comment `### define demo inputs` load results from prior exercises applied to the entire data set and use those to build demo inputs. These must be run for subsequent demos to work properly, but they do not affect the test cells. The data loaded in these cells may be rather large (at least in terms of human readability). You are free to print or otherwise use Python to explore them, but we did not print them in the starter code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Debugging you code:** Right before each exercise test cell, there is a block of text explaining the variables available to you for debugging. You may use these to test your code and can print/display them as needed (careful when printing large objects, you may want to print the head or chunks of rows at a time).\n",

    "\n",
    "While this analysis is based on American football, having a deep knowledge of the intracices of the sport **is not necessary to complete this notebook.** Do not dwell on this primer information.\n",
    "* A football game is a contest between two teams. One team is designated the \"home\" team and one team is designated the \"away\" team. The home/away designation will not change during the game. \n",
    "* Football games are timed. When the game clock reaches zero, the game ends, and the team with the higher score wins.\n",
    "* One team possesses the ball at a time. This team is designated as the offense. The team designated as the offense will change during the course of the game.\n",
    "* When the offense takes possession of the ball it gets 4 attempts to advance the ball to the line to gain. Each attempt is referred to as a \"down\". After the 4th down, if the offense has not advanced the ball to the line to gain the other team will take possession.\n",
    "* If the offense advances the ball past the line to gain, they get another 4 downs and the line to gain is reset to 10 yards of where the progress stopped on the previous attempt.  \n",
    "* On each down the offense has three options:\n",
    "    * Run a play to attempt to advance the ball. There are many potential outcomes, Generally (but not always) the offense will either score a touchdown or retain possession of the ball.\n",
    "    * Punt the ball to the other team. The ball advances, but the other team takes possession.\n",
    "    * Attempt to kick a field goal. A successful attempt scores points, but an unsuccessful attempt will move the ball backwards and turn possession over to the other team.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Our analysis\n",
    "This framework makes the offense's decision on what to do on the fourth down an interesting question. We will provide data-driven guidance on which option (punting, kicking a field goal attempt, or running a play) will give the offense the best chance of winning the game."

    "The score fields (`homeScore` and `awayScore`) indicate the score **after the play occurred**. In order to use the scores as inputs to a model we need to add a lag so that they indicate the score _before the play occurred_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define `lag_score(all_events_df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame`  \n",
    "- Input: all_events_df (DataFrame) - will contain fields `event_id`, `timeLeft`, `awayScore`, `homeScore`  \n",
    "- `all_events_df['event_id']` is expected to have multiple distinct values. _You can not assume that all of the records are from the same game._\n",
    "\n",
    "Your solution should do the following:\n",
    "- Copy `all_events_df` and sort it by `event_id` and `timeLeft`. The order of `event_id` doesn't matter (sorting helps things run faster). However, sorting the records _for each event_ by `timeLeft` _in descending order_ is critical (which is why we must sort by both columns). We will call the sorted copy `df`.  \n",
    "- Partition `df` by `event_id`.\n",
    "- For each partition, set the `homeScore` and `awayScore` values to their values from one row prior. Since the first row has no rows which are prior to it, we will set both score values to 0.\n",
    "  - **Hint** - The [pd.DataFrame.shift](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/1.4/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.shift.html) method will be helpful in accomplishing this step.\n",
    "- Concatenate the partitions together.\n",
    "- Return the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint** - The pattern of making a helper function to introduce the lag for a single game and using it with [`pd.DataFrame.GroupBy.apply`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/1.4/reference/api/pandas.core.groupby.GroupBy.apply.html) will be very helpful in solving this exercise."

    "We fit the model below to estimate the probability that a field goal attempt from a point on the field will be successful. Notice that the probability decays non-linearly as the distance to the endzone increases. From beyond 45 yards away from the endzone (63+ yard field goal) the model estimates the probability as zero. This is very close to the maximum distance a human can place-kick a football, and only a handfull of kicks have been made from that distance in NFL history."

    "This is probably the least intuitive metric we're estimating. The idea is that the state of the game (down, distance, yards to the endzone) has an unrealized effect on what the final score will be. We attempt to quantify this effect by estimating the point value of the next scoring play based on the state of the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "We fit a Scikit-learn Linear Regression model based on the `down`, `distance`, and `yardsToEndzone` fields from the `ep_data` calculated above. In the plot, the colors (blue, orange, green, and red) represent first, second, third, and fourth down, respectively. The distance is frozen at the minimum of 10 and the distance to the endzone (hence the \"bend\" on the left). We see that expected points step down with each down and increase as the ball is closer to the endzone. "

One is being able to model how likely certain events are to occur in a given game situation. That we have accomplished. The second piece is to simulate all of the possible outcomes from a decision so that we can feed them into our win probability model. That we haven't touched, and it actually involves a fair bit of football knowledge. For the sake of sparing the less football-savy among us and keeping this notebook from being _even longer_ we have implemented simulations for all 5 potential outcomes and imported.\n",
